MPI (Message Passing Interface) for D programming language

MPI is specification, API and protocol used mainly by C and Fortran
programms to perform communications. MPI is used mainly
for parallel and distributed computation on multiprocessor
and multinode clusters of computer (so called HPC - High-Performance
Computing).


This modules and scripts enables using MPI
in programms written in D programming language.
C interfaces to MPI are wrapped into templates, classes
and few other usefull functions.

Wrapper automatically performs serializations,
deserialization, type detection, exception handling,
struct packing for custom types, etc.

Work In Progress - doesn't work yet
